# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
In Python, a linked list is a linear data structure that is made up of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a reference to an object and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are used to store data in a dynamic way, as the number of nodes in a linked list can grow or shrink as needed. Each node in a linked list is typically implemented as a separate Python class, with instance variables to store the data and the reference to the next node. The linked list class itself typically contains a reference to the head (first) node in the list and possibly a reference to the tail (last) node as well.
